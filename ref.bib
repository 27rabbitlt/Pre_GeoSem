  abstract     = "This paper gives an algorithm for solving linear
                 programming problems. For a problem with n constraints
                 and d variables, the algorithm requires an expected
                 O(d2n) + (log n)O(d)d/2+O(1) + O(d4√nlog n)
                 arithmetic operations, as n→∞. The constant factors
                 do not depend on d. Also, an algorithm is given for
                 integer linear programming. Let φ bound the number of
                 bits required to specify the rational numbers defining
                 an input constraint or the objective function vector.
                 Let n and d be as before. Then, the algorithm requires
                 expected O(2d dn + 8dd√n ln ln n) + dO(d)φ ln n
                 operations on numbers with dO(1)φ bits, as n→∞,
                 where the constant factors do not depend on d or φ to
                 other convex programming problems. For example, an
                 algorithm for finding the smallest sphere enclosing a
                 set of n points in Ed has the same time bound.",
