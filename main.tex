\begin{frame}{Background}
	Linear programming captures one of the most canonical and influential constrained optimization problems. \\~\

	More precisely, it asks to maximize or minimize a linear objective under linear
	inequality and equality constraints.

\begin{frame}{Previous Work}
	When $d$, the dimension of LP (i.e. the number of variables), is considered to be constant,
	then LP can be solved in time linear in $m$, the number of constraints.

	\vspace{\baselineskip}

	These methods\supercite{M2} are complicated and running time superexponential to $d$: e.g. $3^{d^2}$.

	\vspace{\baselineskip}

	We also have a simple algorithm\supercite{C2} with complexity $O(d^2m) + (\log m)O(d)^{d/2 + O(1)} + O(d^4 \sqrt{m} \log m)$
	but the analysis is involved.

	\vspace{\baselineskip}

	\textbf{The presented algorithm gives a simple procedure and complexity $O(d!m)$.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Algorithm}

	This algorithm makes use of a very simple idea:

	\vspace{\baselineskip}

    Suppose we delete one constraint $\vec{a} x \ge b$, and somehow managed to solve the new LP.
	Then we check if the optimum $x^*$ conforms with the deleted constraint.

	\vspace{\baselineskip}

	\begin{itemize}
        \item If it doesn't violate the constraint, i.e. $\vec{a} x^* \ge b$, then $x^*$ is also 
            the optimum for original LP, because deleting one constraint  
            gives us a larger feasible area.
		\item If it violates the constraint, then the opt value lies on the hyperplane
		      corresponding to this constraint.  We can project the feasible area 
              onto the corresponding hyperplane, thus reducing dimension by 1. Then
              solve the new LP problem with lower dimension.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Algorithm}
    Let original feasible region be $D$, feasible region after deleting constraint be $D'$, the optimum for $D'$ be $x^*$ .
    Clearly $D \subseteq D'$ and in this case $x^* \in D$.
    \begin{align*}
        u^T x^* \underset{\text{(i)}}{\le} \max_{D}  \underset{\text{(ii)}}{\le} \max_{D'} = u^T x^*
    \end{align*}
    
    (i): $x^* \in D$, by definition of $\max$.

    \vspace{\baselineskip}
    
    (ii): Optimizing on a larger area gives no worse optimal value than the original one.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Algorithm}
    Let original feasible region be $D$, feasible region after deleting constraint be $D'$, the optimum for $D'$ be $x^*$ .
    In this case $x^* \notin D$.

	If it violates the constraint, then the opt value lies on the hyperplane
	corresponding to this constraint.

	This is because if we consider the points along the line connecting
	new LP's opt point and original LP's opt point, by convexity we have that
	we have a better point on the hyperplane.
	This is also not bad, at least we decrease the dimension (we restrict the problem
	on a hyperplane, which has dimension $d - 1$), which gives us the intuition to recurssively analyse.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Backward Analysis}
	Sometimes it's hard to determine the probability if thinking \textit{forward}, while surprisingly straightforward if thinking \textit{backward}. \\~\

	\begin{block}{Smallest Enclosing Circle}
		Given a set of points $P$ in Euclidean plane, compute the smallest circle that contains them all.
	\end{block}

	\begin{figure}[r]
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{pics/smallest_enclosing_circle_illustration.png}
		% \caption{}
		% \label{figsmallcircle}
	\end{figure}

	% Given first $i$ points, $\text{Pr}\lf \text{No.}(i+1) \text{ point falls in the interior of circle } C_{i+1} \rf = \;?$ \\~\

	% Given first $i+1$ points, $\text{Pr}\lf \text{No.}(i+1) \text{ point falls in the interior of circle } C_{i+1} \rf = \;?$

	% in fact, the two algorithms shares a trick in analysing some algos in common, it's called backward analysis by Seidel. the details are in depth explained in another paper where the author listed several other algorithms that backward analysis can also apply, either to give a simple proof for a previously complicated algorithm or a completely new, yet still simple proof for a new algorithm.

	% the first one is difficult to calculate because it's intrinsicly difficult. The probability differs when we have different set of first i points. So it's indeed hard to give a probability for any set of first i points, but we don't care about the probability for any specific set of first i points whatsoever: we care about only the expectation: as long as the expectation of this probability among all possible sets of first i points is bounded by some value then we are happy.

	% the second one is smarter in the sense that it doesn't depend on the set of i+1 points. whichever we choose we always have the same probability

	% here we need two pictures illustrating this:
